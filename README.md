## Reflection

This was a 2 week long project built when I was learning React.Js. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

One of the main challenges I ran into was efficiently fetching API data. This lead me to spend a few days on researching React libraries that quickly fetch API data from RESTful API. Also, I modified the application so that API data would be fetched only in the main component and provided to other components using `props`. 

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, VanillaJS, JSX, HTML and CSS. I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes. In the next iteration I plan on using other React libraries to fetch and modify API data.
